<h2 align="center">Google Chrome extension for Vinted chat tagging</h2>

Tagged is a Google Chrome extension that adds the ability to tag chats on Vinted, and identify at a glance, if that specific user is in any of the predefined states (discussing, request additional info, to be shipped, awaiting delivery, awaiting review).

This should help when seller has many active chats and finds it hard to see which chats need attention.

Have I shipped this pair of trousers?

Have I reviewed this buyer?

Have I measured this coat?

With Tagged, once you have tagged the chats, you won't have to ask these questions anymore!

### Roadmap

- Make new chats have an "untagged" tag
- Transform dynamic tags and colours into fixed pairings, to speed-up tagging process

### Fixes

- Fix multi-item chat generating a tag for each picture
